## how to run experiments

There are several alternatives to makefiles that can help keep your experiments reproducible:
1. Dockerfiles: You can use Docker to containerize your experiment and capture all the dependencies and system-level settings needed to run it.
2. Virtual environments: You can create virtual environments with tools like Conda or virtualenv to install specific dependencies and keep them separate from other projects on the same system.
3. Scripts: You can write simple scripts in Python, bash, or other languages to automate your experiments and maintain reproducibility. These scripts can include commands to install dependencies, download datasets, run the model, and save the results.
4. Notebook environments: You can use Jupyter notebooks or other similar tools to keep a record of your experiments, combine code and documentation, and run the experiments in an interactive environment.
5. Workflow management tools: There are several workflow management tools available, such as Snakemake, Nextflow, and Luigi, that can help you define and execute complex pipelines for your experiments.
Each of these alternatives has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the best choice depends on your specific use case and goals.

Sure, here's a possible folder structure based on your requirements:
```
project-name/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── results/
├── models/
│   ├── model1/
│   ├── model2/

└── README.md
```
In this structure, you have separate folders for data, models, and scripts. The `data` folder has subfolders for raw, processed, and results data. The `models` folder has subfolders for individual models, and the `scripts` folder has subfolders for model definition, training, utilities, and analysis scripts.
You can use the `notebooks` folder to store Jupyter notebooks that run and document your experiments. And the `environment.yml` file can be used to create a Conda environment with all the necessary dependencies to run your scripts.
This structure is just a suggestion, and you can modify it based on your specific needs and conventions. The main idea is to keep your code organized and easy to maintain, so you can focus on your research instead of searching for files and scripts.
